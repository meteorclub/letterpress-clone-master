Feature: Create a Landing Page

  As an author
  I want to create a landing page
  So that I can entice people to purchase my content

  Scenario: Author landing page with markdown
    Given I created a landing page
    When  a visitor navigates to the page
    Then  they see the cover image from "/cover.jpg"
    And   they see the tag-line "Learn how to do something"

  @dev
  Scenario: See a table of content
    Given I created a landing page
    And   I created a chapter called "Holistic Agencies" at "/holistic-agencies" with the following markdown
          """
          How to get a sofa into a room it won't fit in.
          """
    And   I created a chapter called "Forty Two" at "/forty-two" with the following markdown
          """
          The answer to life, universe and everything.
          """
    When  a visitor navigates to the page
    Then  they see the chapter "Holistic Agencies" in the table of contents with the description
          """
          How to get a sofa into a room it won't fit in.
          """
    And   they can navigate to "Holistic Agencies" at "holistic-agencies"
    And   they see the chapter "Forty Two" in the table of contents with the description
          """
          The answer to life, universe and everything.
          """
    And   they can navigate to "Forty Two" at "forty-two"
